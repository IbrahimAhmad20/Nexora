\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis presents the development of Nexora, a modern full-stack web application designed as a comprehensive e-commerce platform. The project was developed by a team of three students from Bahria University, implementing advanced features for customers, vendors, and administrators.

The system architecture follows a three-tier design, utilizing Node.js and Express.js for the backend, MySQL for the database, and modern web technologies for the frontend. The implementation includes role-based access control, secure payment processing, real-time order tracking, and a comprehensive admin dashboard.

Key features of the platform include user authentication, product management, shopping cart functionality, order processing, and vendor management. The system is deployed across multiple cloud platforms including Render, Netlify, and Clever Cloud, ensuring high availability and scalability.

The project demonstrates the practical application of modern web development technologies and best practices in software engineering, including agile methodology, version control, and comprehensive testing strategies.
