\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Key Findings}
The results indicate that Nexora meets its design goals for performance, security, and usability. The system handled concurrent users efficiently, maintained data integrity, and provided a seamless user experience. The modular architecture and comprehensive testing contributed to the platform's robustness.

Key findings include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The use of MySQL with proper indexing and query optimization ensured fast data access
    \item The RESTful API design facilitated integration and scalability
    \item Security best practices minimized vulnerabilities
    \item Automated and manual testing improved reliability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
While the platform performed well, some limitations were observed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Performance under extremely high load could be further optimized
    \item Some advanced features (e.g., real-time analytics) were not implemented
    \item Further usability testing with a larger user base is recommended
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
Overall, the Nexora project achieved its objectives, delivering a modern, secure, and performant e-commerce platform. The results validate the design and implementation choices, while also highlighting areas for future improvement.
